### Ukrainians and the whole world [send Putin to Jupiter](https://putler.io/).
### [Real ways you can help Ukraine](https://how-to-help-ukraine-now.super.site/)
***

##### On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation cowardly attacked independent Ukraine. They are waging a dirty information war against the whole world and direct armed warfare on the territory of Ukraine.
##### The publicly available IT projects, package managers, forums, CDNs, and other resources created for the benefit and convenience of IT professionals are now used to wage war and destroy innocent civilians. We also believe that these resources (i.e. source code, software, and other digital information) help disseminate false information in Russia and can be used to conduct military operations. These resources also make it possible to finance and continue the war in Ukraine with the help of the Russian IT sector.

## We call you to stop helping the Russian IT sector in any activity.

## We call you to stop using Russian information resources and not finance the Russian IT sector, because this way you finance the war.

## We call to the public resources providers used by the Russian IT sector to restrict any traffic and access to these networks from Russia:
